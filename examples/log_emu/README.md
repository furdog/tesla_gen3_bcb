This example is a th3spmc emulator that reads log file (with CAN frames) and
tries to replicate valid behaviour.

The implementation is quite bad (sorry for that), but it tries to replicate
arduino behaviour in real time and does it correctly. I plan to do more
universal log parser in the future, but i am not sure if it ever gets here.
